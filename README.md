# Google Files Opener

Hi, Tired of installing multiple file editors that takes up so much ram that you can't even use spotify in the background (personal issue), so the bash script opens those file in google slides, docs and sheets.

This will not work if you copy paste this, you'll have to go through gdrive (google drive cli) creation process which i still dont understand why i had to do that much stuff but refer the link down below
then after getting the appropriate credentials and gdrive set up this will work

Download the [binary](https://github.com/glotlabs/gdrive?tab=readme-ov-file) or sudo pacman -S gdrive or something 
Refer this doc for gdrive setup [doc](https://github.com/glotlabs/gdrive/blob/main/docs/create_google_api_credentials.md)

thx bye
